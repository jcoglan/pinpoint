Version 0.4.0
April 29 2009
================================================================

* Additions to core:
    * Custom DOM events. DomCollection#on() treats event names
      containing colons as custom events, and a fire() method
      is provided for notifying observers.

* Bug fixes:
    * DomCollection#set() handles boolean attributes correctly
    * '+' symbols in URLs are now parsed as spaces by Ojay.HTTP

* New packages: Tabs

* Additions to Forms package:
    * New method: Ojay.Forms.submit(form) acts as a replacement
      for Form#submit() that respects validation and Ajax rules.

* Additions to HTTP package:
    * Raw strings can be used as the body for POST requests, e.g.
      Ojay.HTTP.POST('/endpoint', 'request body', { /* callbacks */ })

* Additions to Paginator package:
    * New methods: push(), pop(), shift() and unshift() for
      adding and removing items from Paginators


Version 0.3.1
December 1 2008
================================================================

* Bug fixes:
    * Fixed some layout-related problems with Accordion in
      Internet Explorer.
    * Added ability to pass options to Forms constructors, with
      an option to set the position type used to wrap form
      inputs (wrapperPosition). See Forms documentation for
      more information.


Version 0.3.0
October 31 2008
================================================================

* JS.Class updated to 2.0.2. This does not affect the Ojay API
  but will affect you if you use JS.Class explicitly yourself.
  See http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/upgrade.html

* New packages: Accordion

* Additions to core:
    * Observable now causes and event to bubble up the inheritance
      tree of the object that fired it. So you can listen to all
      instances of Paginator using Ojay.Paginator.on()
    * Multiple CSS selector engines are now supported, and new ones
      can be added fairly easily. Supports W3C API, YUI, Ext,
      Sizzle and Peppy out of the box.
    * New method for animated scrolling: DomCollection#scroll().

* Additions to Forms package:
    * Ojay.Forms.setValue() now selects options in drop-down
      menus based on text content, not just values

* Additions to HTTP package:
    * onSuccess callbacks can now be specified implicitly, like
      they are in jQuery. If you supply a single function (rather
      than a named list), that function is taken to be onSuccess.
      e.g.
          
          Ojay.HTTP.GET('/search', {q: 'hello'}, function(r) { ... });
      
    * Better JSON-P support for calling third-party domains. You
      can now use standard Ajax syntax rather than using a named
      global function for talking to JSON-P services.

* Additions to Overlay package:
    * ContentOverlay#fitToContent() can now animate the transition
      between sizes, and balance the change so the center of the
      overlay does not move.

* Additions to Paginator package:
    * Paginator now supports two additional options: 'looped' and
      'infinite'. Looped mode allows the prev/next buttons to wrap
      around the loop of pages, and infinite mode allows the paginator
      to keep scrolling indefinitely in the same direction.

* Bug fixes:
    * Ojay.HTML.input() generates inputs with the correct type in IE
    * DomCollection#setAttributes() was failing on attrs that required
      use of HTMLElement#setAttribute. This is now fixed.

* Deprecations:
    * HTTP.Response#evalScriptTags() has been removed. Use
      HTTP.Response#evalScripts().
    * DomCollection#setAttributes() has been deprecated in favour of
      the shorter DomCollection#set()


Version 0.2.1
August 6 2008
================================================================

* The first argument to Keyboard.listen() is now optional, and
  defaults to 'document'.
* Keyboard.RuleSet() can take a node to listen to as the first
  argument. This is optional and defaults to 'document'.
* Forms package does not validate fields that are hidden using
  'display: none'.


Version 0.2.0
June 13 2008
================================================================

* JS.Class upgraded to 1.6.1
* Ojay compatible with current experimental branch of JS.Class
* New packages: Forms, Keyboard, Overlay and Paginator

* Additions to the core library:
    * Ojay.delegateEvent()
    * Ojay.Observable module, allows any class to support the on() method
    * CSS queries use document.querySelectorAll() if available
    * Ojay.getVisibleRegion() returns the Region for the part of the
      page exposed by the viewport
    * Number#times() for Ruby-style looping
    * String#parseJSON(), a shortcut for YAHOO.lang.JSON.parse()
    * HtmlBuilder#concat() allows existing nodes to be inserted into
      the element between other tag calls
    * HtmlBuilder can take HTMLElements as arguments so you can nest
      elements without using functions
    * New Region scaling and translation methods

* Additions to HTTP package:
    * HTTP.Response#insertInto() can accept any object with a
      setContent() method, e.g. Overlay objects
    * HTTP includes Observable and publishes events for HTTP traffic
    * New catch-all onComplete callback for requests

* Bug fixes:
    * Opacity animations remove filters properly in IE
    * DomCollection#setContent() works with SELECT and TABLE elements
    * HTTP URL parser handles valueless parameters correctly in IE

* Deprecations
    * HTTP.Response#evalScriptTags() is deprecated and will be removed
      by version 0.3. Use HTTP.Response#evalScripts() instead.
