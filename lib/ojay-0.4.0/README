INTRODUCTION
============

Ojay is a JavaScript programming interface that wraps the Yahoo! User Interface library. It
aims to make code easier to read and write, by allowing more sentence-like OO syntax and
minimizing repetition.

The download contains two copies of all files; one containing the full source code and
one minified for production use. For best performance, it is recommended that you serve
the minified files on live sites, and use gzip/deflate compression. You can do this by
enabling mod_deflate in Apache and adding this line to your site's config:

  AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/javascript application/x-javascript

Ojay's build files are generated using Jake, a Ruby program that uses Dean Edwards' Packer
to compress code. The download also contains a file named yui.js, which contains all the
YUI build files used by Ojay in one concatenated file. It includes the following:

  * yahoo-dom-event
  * selector
  * json
  * animation
  * connection
  * get
  * cookie
  * history

Further information and docs are available on the Ojay site: http://ojay.othermedia.org


DEVELOPMENT
===========

If you're checking this code out from the repository, you'll need to build the library from
the source files (contained in the /source directory). To do this, you'll need Ruby installed.
You can get Ruby for any platform from their web site:

http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

You'll also need the Jake gem to generate build files, and the staticmatic gem to view the
doc site and run tests.

gem install jake
gem install staticmatic

Once you've got Ruby installed, open a command prompt in the root directory (one level up
from /source) and type 'jake'. That command will combine and compress the source files and
place them in the /build directory.

To start a server for the docs/test site, type

staticmatic preview site

The site is then available at http://localhost:3030, and the test suite at http://localhost:3030/test/
